# camera

I tried to build the standard diy rc car with jetson nano and lte radio. finally got it working, only to then get my sim card banned by aby the fcc... Need to use android phone with approved id.


Android kinda sucks and is hard to develop on.

This is basically turning into a mini-openpilot taking qualcomm camera code, usb communication stuff, and video encoding module out. Just need to add video streaming code (rtp or ideally webrtc/janus).
